**MailTrackerBlocker** is a tracker blocker for Mail. Email marketers and other interests often embed invisible trackers in HTML emails so they can track how often, when and where you open your emails. Enable the included Mail extension to find out who is tracking you and to block spy pixels from your emails.

### How to enable the blocker

1. Open the Mail app.
2. Goto Mail > Settings > Extensions.
3. Check `MailTrackerBlocker` to enable it. If you have multiple message security extensions installed, set "Message security extension" to `MailTrackerBlocker` to ensure trackers are blocked.

Note: Enabling Mail > Privacy > "Block All Remote Content" with MailTrackerBlocker enabled is redundant; disable "Block All Remote Content" for the best experience.

### Tracking Report

Open the MailTrackerBlocker app or tap the 🧩 puzzle icon in Mail that appears over the message pane header (note: the 🧩 puzzle icon is hidden if the selected e-mail has an attachment). The Tracking Report shows a rolling 30-day overview of e-mails grouped by tracker along with some frequency statistics.


## FAQ

### Does this work with Mail Privacy Protection?

Yes, even in network environments (e.g. VPN) where Mail Privacy Protection doesn't work, MailTrackerBlocker will still block and identify trackers if you choose to "Load Remote Content".

### Why is my Mail so slow?

Such problems can be usually be resolved by doing a [complete Mailbox Rebuild](https://c-command.com/spamsieve/help/how-can-i-rebuild-apple) to force Mail to regenerate its indexes.
