![Extension](https://github.com/apparition47/MailTrackerBlockerApp/raw/main/Assets/preview.jpg)

MailTrackerBlocker is an email tracker blocker for Apple Mail on macOS. Email marketers and other interests embed invisible trackers in HTML emails so they can track if you've read an email, which device you used, how often, when and where you opened your email. Enable the included Mail Extension to find out who is tracking you and to block these spy pixels in your emails.

MailTrackerBlocker for Mail is simple and easy to use. Just one flip of the switch to start blocking intrusive trackers as you read through your inbox. Click the little â“§ icon in the message header to find out what was blocked.


## KEY FEATURES:

- Mail Extension: built specifically for macOS Sonoma and Apple Mail.

- Privacy protection: Blocks most spy pixels which can capture your IP address and function as read receipts and more.

- Be informed: Identifies nearly 300 of the most common email marketing vendors.

- Tracker report: See a 30-day overview of blocked trackers in read emails along with some summary statistics.


## NOTE:

Mail only allows up to one active Message Security Extension at a time. Set MailTrackerBlocker as your active Message Security Extension to unlock tracker report functionality.
